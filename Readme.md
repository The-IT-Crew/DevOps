#  🐍 Introduction to DevOps
**1. Methodology**

## Waterfall Methodology
For requirement and gathering analysis
lets look at the map
<p>Design  → Implement → Test →Deploy → Maintainence </p>
<h2> Limitations</h2>

 - High amount of risk and un-certaincy.
 - No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.
 - Not a good model for complex and object oriented projects.
 - Not suitable for the project where requirment are not a moderate of a high risk of changing.
 - Once the application in its testing phase, it is very difficult to go back and change something, that was not to well for the project.
  <h2> Agile Methodology </h2>
  <p>In the <b> agile </b> methodology each project  is broken upto into several iterations.' All the iterations should be of the same time duration (close to 2 to 8 weeks).  </br>
 At the end of each iteration, a working product should be delivered. </p>
lets see the map
<p> Analyze → Plan →<b> Design → Bulid → Test</b> → Deploy </p>
So design , Bulid and Test is iterating unil the final Product is delivered.<br>
<b> Design → Bulid → Test</b> <br>
<b> Design → Bulid → Test</b> <br>
<b> Design → Bulid → Test</b><br> &darr; <br>
<strong>Final Deployment to Server</strong>
