#  üêç Introduction to DevOps
**2. Devops Stages**
<h2> Version Control</h2>
<p>Version control is a set of practices and tools for managing codebases. Developers use version control to keep track of every line of code, and share, review, and synchronize changes among a team.</p>
<p> Other version control tools like-
 
 - Mercurial
 -  Apache Subversion (SVN)
 - Concurrent Version Systems (CVS)
 - Perforce
 - Bazaar
 - Bitkeeper
 -  Fossil

<p><h3>How the Centralized version control system works ?</h3></p>
<img src='../Images/image2.png' alt='cvcs'>
<p>Centralized control version system only has 2 repositories a master repositories and client repositories.</br>
The server act as a master repositories and developers personal workspace acts as a client repositories. Everytime the user/client
need to be on the same network to access the master repositories because you can't access it remotely. User/Client commits directly to the <code> main </code> branch.
Centralized version control system basically used for small team member and large file commits.</p>
<h3>Advantages of CVCS</h3>
<hr>
<p>When a developer chnages to the bulid and push it to the server repositories there should be a commit message, showing who and which exact file they changed and where did actually the code changed. </p>
<p> Binary files, such as graphic assets and text files, require a large amount of space, so software developers turn to centralized version control systems to store this data. With a centralized server, teams can pull a few lines of code without saving the entire history on their local machine. Users of distributed systems have to download the entire project, which takes up time and space and prevents them from doing diffs. If a team works with binary files regularly, a centralized system offers the most efficient approach to code development.</p>

### Disadvantage of CVCS
<hr>
<p>All the system main files and metadata are stored in to an single repositories. If, somehow the server's main repositories crashed or get corrupted, all the system files would be lost,</p>
<p>Also, u can't access the data form server remotely, you will always need to be on a specific network to access it.</p>
