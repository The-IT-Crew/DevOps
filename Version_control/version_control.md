<p><h3>How the Centralized version control system works ?</h3></p>
<img src='../Images/image2.png' alt='cvcs'>
<p>Centralized control version system only has 2 repositories a master repositories and client repositories.</br>
The server act as a master repositories and developers personal workspace acts as a client repositories. Everytime the user/client
need to be on the same network to access the master repositories because you can't access it remotely. User/Client commits directly to the <code> main </code> branch.
Centralized version control system basically used for small team member and large file commits.</p>
